Do you enjoy the iPad, but also find that many websites have links that are just THAT little bit too small for your users to enjoy on the iPad?

Enter iPadify - if you want your webpage be more usable on the iPad without much change.

Simply put this one line of code into your html:

    <script type="text/javascript" src='http://ipadify.heroku.com/ipadify.js'/>

 - Themes
 
 The code is a simple rails app hosted on heroku.
